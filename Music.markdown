I like to make music sometimes! Mostly for my gamedev projects but I've also been working on some covers lately

I just can't wait to die. <br />
My first ever song cover, I'm thinking of making more of these and making an album out of them.

# Development Hell Demos
{:center}
![](/img/devhelldemo.png){:width="200px" center} <br /> <br />
Development Hell is a cover album based on my main Spotify Playlist "My Random Mix For Development Hell." I want it to showcase my music taste that can franky be a bit all over the place. This is where I'll be posting the W.I.P. demos as I make them. Development Hell is only a side project at the moment so don't expect consistent updates.
